In that game, which was played in a rare snowstorm in Dallas, the Dolphins squibbed their attempt at a game-winning field goal, leaving the ball spinning on the ground with members of the Cowboys surrounding it waiting for it to stop in order to declare it dead. However, Leon Lett ran up to try to grab it, but slipped and inadvertently batted the ball away, which made it a live ball again. The Dolphins recovered, tried the field goal again, and were successful, winning the game.</td>\n",

In fact, although his father flirted a little with a female neighbor, the show made it clear that they never had sex.\\nBut this is only one of many discrepancies between what the adult Sheldon said about his family life on The Big Bang Theory (2007) and what is depicted on \"Young Sheldon\".\\nFor example, the adult Sheldon made frequent references to his father having a serious drinking problem, but on the prequel, his father only enjoys an occasional beer, is never seen drunk, and seems like a moderate drinker. The adult Sheldon also talked about his parents fighting and bickering all the time, yet that doesn't happen on the prequel either. His parents have a normal number of familial disagreements, but nothing out of the ordinary.</td>\n",

Campbell and Pemberton confirming Amy and Sheldon's theory is similar to one in history mentioned by Leonard:When trying to gather evidence of the Big Bang, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, who were astrophysicists at Princeton University, were preparing to search for microwave radiation. Dicke and his colleagues reasoned that the Big Bang must have scattered not only the matter that condensed into galaxies but also must have released a tremendous blast of radiation. With the proper instrumentation, this radiation should be detectable.At the same time, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, in 1964, were experimenting with a super sensitive, 6 meter (20 ft) horn antenna originally built to detect radio waves bounced off Echo balloon satellites. To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable interference from their receiver. When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data they found a low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver.This mysterious noise was eventually recognized as the radiation predicted by Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton. In 1978, Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize for Physics.</td>\n",

Raj also says, \"How about the girl from 'The Wonder Years'?\" He is referring to Danica McKellar, who has a degree in mathematics, coauthored a physics theorem, and appears in the Season 3 episode The Psychic Vortex (2010) as Abby. Coincidentally, in The Wonder Years (1988), her character's last name is Cooper.  \n",

Parsons credits former show writer Stephen Engel with inventing the word. It became such a catchphrase on the show that a Brazilian species of orchid bee was later named 'Euglossa bazinga' in its honor, especially since this bee had long-time been confused with the Euglossa ignita, and had thus 'fooled' entomologists for years.  \n",

Howard claims that 9 prop rings were made (the 9 rings given to the race of Men), 3 were taken home by members of the cast (3 rings were given to the Elves), and the rest destroyed, leaving just this ring (the One Ring). In actuality, many more replicas were made over the course of shooting the films.  \n",

Weightlessness was created by supporting the actors on a very thin platform and have them simulate the effects of microgravity.  \n",

He even recounted how he risked getting the nickname \"Crybaby\" over how he teared up while looking at Earth during a spacewalk, which could have shorted out something in his helmet and provoke an investigation in which he'd would have to admit to crying.  \n",

Smith instead of Samantha Smith)\", and Sheldon names J.K. Rowling and Star Trek's D.C. Fontana as examples. Dorothy Fontana was a very prolific writer on several Star Trek series, but when she began writing for Star Trek (1966), creator Gene Roddenberry indeed advised her to submit screenplays using her initials \"D.C.\", as networks and studio executives in the 1960s were generally very biased against women writing science-fiction. The real Fontana had actually made a cameo appearance in The Russian Rocket Reaction (2011). Harry Potter author Joanne Rowling was asked by her publisher to use initials, out of fear that the target audience of young boys might be put off by books written by a woman. Even in later years, when Fontana and Rowling became well-known and established writers, they often kept using their better-known initials rather than their full name.  \n",

Actually, writer Jim Davis himself once stated that Garfield's life is basically the same from day to day, but for some reason, a disproportionate amount of misfortune and bad luck seems to occur on Mondays. Garfield hates them because it is when he realizes that his life is an empty cycle of repeating days, and the Mondays are just a bit more awful than the rest. There is also a popular fan theory that Garfield hates Mondays because that is when Jon, his owner, goes to work; therefore, this is his way of saying, without actually saying it, that he loves Jon.  \n",

In that game, which was played in a rare snowstorm in Dallas, the Dolphins squibbed their attempt at a game-winning field goal, leaving the ball spinning on the ground with members of the Cowboys surrounding it waiting for it to stop in order to declare it dead. However, Leon Lett ran up to try to grab it, but slipped and inadvertently batted the ball away, which made it a live ball again. The Dolphins recovered, tried the field goal again, and were successful, winning the game.  \n",

James Earl Jones would always be in a sound booth providing the voice of Darth Vader, and Carrie Fisher would be on set with David Prowse, who provided the physical acting of Darth Vader. This is paralleled in their scene together in this episode where we see Carrie Fisher on-screen , but only hear the voice of James Earl Jones, who is off-screen. The first time they met, Fisher yelled \"DAD!\" to Jones, a reference to Darth Vader being the father of Princess Leia.  \n",

Both of those sources have helium as a gas. The really hard part of making liquid helium is not obtaining the gas but getting it cold enough to liquefy (about -269 degrees C). And because no container is perfectly insulated a tank of liquid helium will warm up and boil off in just a few days.  \n",

This is a reference to the seventh season episode The Scavenger Vortex (2013) that was aired 2.5 years before: it refers to when the two were paired together for the scavenger hunt created by Raj, or the Neil Diamond concert the two said they should go to.  \n",

But on the prequel show Young Sheldon (2017), the incident happens differently. For one, Sheldon is 14, not 13, and he walks in on his parents having sex with each other, with his mother dressed in a German Beer Waitress costume, not on his father having sex with another woman. In fact, although his father flirted a little with a female neighbor, the show made it clear that they never had sex.\\nBut this is only one of many discrepancies between what the adult Sheldon said about his family life on The Big Bang Theory (2007) and what is depicted on \"Young Sheldon\".\\nFor example, the adult Sheldon made frequent references to his father having a serious drinking problem, but on the prequel, his father only enjoys an occasional beer, is never seen drunk, and seems like a moderate drinker. The adult Sheldon also talked about his parents fighting and bickering all the time, yet that doesn't happen on the prequel either. His parents have a normal number of familial disagreements, but nothing out of the ordinary.  \n",

In this secret language, the letters \"ub\" are added in front of each vowel sound in every syllable of an existing word, e.g. \"hello\" becomes \"huballubo\". It may also have been the inspiration for Amy's invented language 'Op' from The Skank Reflex Analysis (2011), where the letters \"op\" are added to each consonant in a word (so \"hallo\" would become \"hop-a-lop-lop-o\").  \n",

Sheldon was learning to speak Mandarin (poorly) during The Tangerine Factor (2008), and later recognized the tattoo on Penny's buttocks as the Chinese symbol for \"soup\" in The Adhesive Duck Deficiency (2009), so he may have used his knowledge to translate \"Soft Kitty\" into the language.  \n",

Feynman was known for his simple visual representations of complex mathematical expressions (\"It appears we're inside a joke\"); Einstein's theory of Special Relativity states that synchronous movement of objects depends on who is observing these movements (\"But only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously\"). The thought experiment of 'Schrödinger's cat' (mentioned on the show several times since The Tangerine Factor (2008)) describes a cat in a closed box with a vial of poison set to break at an unknown time; the only way to know for certain if the cat has died is by looking inside the box (\"If someone is looking in the window, I'm leaving\"). Sheldon's joke about Heisenberg being told he was going 85 miles per hour refers to the 'Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle', or the inability to measure both an object's location and speed in one observation (\"Darn it, now I don't know where I am\").  \n",

He obtained a learner's permit in The Euclid Alternative (2008) and drove Penny to the hospital for an emergency in The Adhesive Duck Deficiency (2009), but always claimed that he never got a real driver's license. That is, until The Space Probe Disintegration (2015) where he admitted to Leonard that he had obtained a permit after Amy gave him lessons, but kept this quiet (even from Amy) since he prefers to be driven around. In The Allowance Evaporation (2017), he also had to confess it to Amy. That makes Howard the third person to know about Sheldon's license.  \n",

Topsy was killed in 1903 and her electrocution was filmed by the Edison film company (see Electrocuting an Elephant (1903)), but contrary to popular belief, she was not electrocuted because Edison wanted to demonstrate the dangers of alternating current (the \"war of the currents\" has been settled in the 1890s) but because her owners wanted to get rid of her, as she had a reputation for being difficult and had killed a man. Thomas Edison does not seem to have even been present on Coney Island, where the electrocution took place, that day.  \n",

Tyson apparently doesn't remember Raj, who introduced him to Sheldon in the season 4 episode The Apology Insufficiency (2010). Also, in that episode, Tyson told Sheldon that he actually wasn't the one who demoted Pluto, but that it was due to a vote by the International Astronomical Unit (however, Tyson had already supported the notion for years, and later apologized to Sheldon anyway).  \n",

       "       13       The story line of Drs. Campbell and Pemberton confirming Amy and Sheldon's theory is similar to one in history mentioned by Leonard:When trying to gather evidence of the Big Bang, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, who were astrophysicists at Princeton University, were preparing to search for microwave radiation. Dicke and his colleagues reasoned that the Big Bang must have scattered not only the matter that condensed into galaxies but also must have released a tremendous blast of radiation. With the proper instrumentation, this radiation should be detectable.At the same time, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, in 1964, were experimenting with a super sensitive, 6 meter (20 ft) horn antenna originally built to detect radio waves bounced off Echo balloon satellites. To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable interference from their receiver. When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data they found a low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver.This mysterious noise was eventually recognized as the radiation predicted by Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton. In 1978, Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize for Physics.  \n",
