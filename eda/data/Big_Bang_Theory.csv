To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable interference from their receiver. When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data they found a low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver.This mysterious noise was eventually recognized as the radiation predicted by Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton.
